# 🏗 Architecture Overview

This project follows a fully serverless, event-driven architecture using AWS managed services.

## Architecture Flow

1. User accesses the React application hosted on Amazon Amplify.
2. Authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito using Hosted UI (OAuth 2.0).
3. Upon successful login, Cognito issues an Access Token.
4. The React app sends authenticated requests to Amazon API Gateway.
5. API Gateway validates the token using a Cognito Authorizer.
6. Valid requests are forwarded to an AWS Lambda function.
7. Lambda performs CRUD operations on Amazon DynamoDB.
8. Logs and metrics are captured by Amazon CloudWatch.
9. Distributed tracing is enabled using AWS X-Ray.

## Why This Architecture

- No servers to manage
- Highly scalable
- Secure by default
- Cost-efficient
- Production-ready
